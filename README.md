# ML-Based-Multipal-Price-Prediction-System
:wave: Hi All :smile: it's my first ML project which is combination of different price prediction models using machine learning.

I deployed my moodel using streamlit.[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)]

In below video you can check the workflow and overview of this project.:point_down:

## List Of ML Models :

### 1.Dimaond Price Prediction.
### 2.Domastic Flight Price Prediction.
### 3.US House Price prediction.

>### 1.Dimaond Price Prediction.
>I have considered the classic Diamonds dataset which contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds and this dataset is hosted on Kaggle. The dataset contains 53940 rows and 10 variables.let’s have a look into the variables & their definitions.

-Price is in US dollars
-Carat weight of the diamond
-Cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
-color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
-clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
-x length in mm
-y width in mm
-z depth in m
-depth: The height of a diamond
-table: The width of the diamond’s table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter
